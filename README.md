# Login Register Form with Flask + SQLAlchemy


I have just started learning Flask and I am developing a project. I plan to share some special things I do occasionally. This form I share with, in the light of new beginners. You can use this simple and useful form as you like.

### Requirements

    pip install flask
    pip install SQLAlchemy
    pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy



### In This Project

With SQLAlchemy, data logging and data retrieval to the database and user registration and logging were performed. That is all :)
